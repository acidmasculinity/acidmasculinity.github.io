Analyzes the rhetoric of madness around school shootings. Internet
forums strike me as a kairotic space in the sense Price
discusses. Counter-strategic resistance and counter-diagnostic
strategies of incoherence and proliferation strike me as relevant to
chan culture. The whole rhetoric of facts and logic used in the right
is also relevant here.
