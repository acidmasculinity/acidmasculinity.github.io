I think this essay is often misread.  I think a focus on housing is
important in part to avoid a Proudhonist line emerging amongst the
people.  Communists should support the industrialization of housing
(municipality-operated rental units, institutional landlords, etc...)
which produce the conditions for the socialization of housing, and the
abolition of the privately owned household.
