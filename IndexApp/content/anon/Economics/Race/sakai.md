Not sure why people get so mad about this one.

IMO the main problem with these sorts of books is that they don't
really discuss what being a settler really is.  Settler status boils
down to being bribed with potential land grants by the state.  It's
still interesting to read what crimes men will do for access to the
capitalist class.
