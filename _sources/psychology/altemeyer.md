Psychologist Bob Altemeyer summarizes his research on the psychology
of "right-wing authoritarians" and "social dominants." Political
psychology can explain the psychology of protest masculinities, but
cannot tell us the technosocial factors which determine who is made to
engage in internet protest masculinities. Authoritarianism is not a
kind of madness. Who participates in an authoritarian political
movement is as much technosocial as psychological.
