title: "Our Enemies in Blue: Police and Power in America"

Williams discusses the origins of North-American policing in slavery
and oppression.  In light of "copaganda" depicting the police officer
as an ideal form of masculinity, the oppressive and violent history
and function of policing can help explain issues with protest
masculinities today.
