title: "Our Enemies in Blue: Police and Power in America"
---

Williams discusses the origins of North-American policing in slavery
and other oppression.  In light of "copaganda" depicting the police
officer as an ideal form of masculinity, the oppressive and violent
history and function of policing may explain many of the issues with
protest masculinities today.
