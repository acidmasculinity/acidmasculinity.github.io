title: "The Second Sex: Facts and Myths"

Beauvoir asserts the origin of misogyny in the mythmaking of women. As
mythical Other, women are split between demon and goddess.  Men seeing
women as the Other, may develop tendencies of entitlement and sadism.
And women in response, may develop tendencies of narcissism and
masochism.  Such ideas of the One and the Other may be applied to
internet protest masculinities, both in position as the One and the
Other.
